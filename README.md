Introduction
------------

0watch scans websites for new releases using arbitrary Python code snippets.
When new releases are detected [0template](https://github.com/0install/0template) is used to create/update a [Zero Install](http://0install.net/) feed.

To make the `0watch` command available on your command-line you can run:

    0alias 0watch http://0install.net/tools/0watch.xml
